Have you not seen the amount of pulled pork threads we have on this sub? Jawsus!
I hope that your other posts aren't as bland as the pulled pork you're gonna be making!
Pulled pork, pulled pork, pulled pork! Why don't you try an original slowcooker recipe instead?
Hell, try another meat ffs. Everyone and their grandmother has done pulled pork already!
Pull a muscle, not pork. At least that would be more original!
I have plenty of pulled pork puns and they're still more original than this submission!
